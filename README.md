# Building, Testing, and Publishing

First, initialize the collection of models by running the following terminal commands:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, assuming that you have [Node.js 14, 16, or 18+](https://nodejs.org/) installed, you should be able to do:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

And you'll get everything packaged up to the `dist/` folder.  `nettango.js` is the entry point.

To test run `npm run test`.  To publish run `npm publish`; you must have appropriate credentials configured for npm.

# Developing NetTango Web with NetLogo Web

NetTango is included as a normal package dependency by the Galapagos project.  It's used there to create the NetTango builder, which enables creation of domain-specific NetTango Web projects that can be run in "play mode" by end users.  Doing development of NetTango Web often includes changes to this NetTango core library, which is used to create the drag and drop block workspaces and to generate the code from the blocks the user has positioned.

To work on the whole NetTango Web application, you will need to get [the Galapagos repository building and running](https://github.com/NetLogo/Galapagos/wiki/Building-and-running).  The Galapagos repository contains [a utility script](https://github.com/NetLogo/Galapagos/blob/master/scripts/nettango-package.sh) that contains more information on a workflow for making changes to this core library and getting it used by a local version of the Galapagos repository.  The short version is that you need:

1) To use `npm` to link your local core library instead of the public release version, to make sure your version is picked up when you do `sbt run` to start the Play Framework development web server.
2) To manually copy your generated NetTango core library files when you make changes after starting the web server, as it won't seen those changes without restarting (which takes a long time).  The utility script does this for you.

# Getting Started with NetTango Modeling

NetTango is published as a package on [the npm package directory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nettango).  You can include it as a regular JavaScript dependency if your project uses a `package.json` file with the `npm` or `yarn` tools:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "nettango": "0.11.1"
  }
}
```

To create a NetTango workspace, you will need to include the `nettango.js` file in your project, as well as the `nettango.css` file for styling.

A basic HTML example might them look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>NetTango Example</title>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="nettango.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <script src="nettango.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="nt-containerish">
    <canvas id="nt-workspace" width="800" height="600" style="background: #fef9f6;"></canvas>
  </div>

<script>

document.body.onload = function() {

  // STEP 1: Define the blocks in the workspace
  var workspaceDefinition = {
    "blocks" : [
      {
        "action" : "test block"
      }
    ]
  };


  // STEP 2: Initialize the workspace (with the canvasId and the list of blocks)
  NetTango.restore("nt-workspace", workspaceDefinition);

  // STEP 3: Add a callback to catch program changed events
  NetTango.addProgramChangedCallback("nt-workspace", function(canvasId) {
    var code = NetTango.exportCode(canvasId, "NetLogo");
    console.log(code);

    // send code to NetLogo Web here!
  });
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Load this file into a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). If everything works, you should see a workspace with just one block available in the menu.

The next step is to try a more full-fledged block definition object. Try replacing workspaceDefinition with this object:

```js
  var workspaceDefinition = {
    "blocks" : [
      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   wolf actions ",
        "type" : "nlogo:procedure",
        "start" : true,
        "limit" : 1,
        "format" : "to wolf-actions",
        "blockColor" : "#b55",
        "required" : true
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   forward",
        "format" : "forward {0}",
        "params" : [
          {
            "type" : "range",
            "min" : 0,
            "max" : 3,
            "step" : 0.1,
            "default" : 1,
            "name" : "steps"
          }
        ]
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   left",
        "format" : "left random {0}",
        "params" : [
          {
            "type" : "range",
            "min" : 0,
            "max" : 90,
            "step" : 1,
            "default" : 50,
            "random" : true,
            "name" : "amount",
            "unit" : "\u00B0"
          }
        ]
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   right",
        "format" : "right random {0}",
        "params" : [
          {
            "type" : "range",
            "min" : 0,
            "max" : 90,
            "step" : 1,
            "default" : 50,
            "random" : true,
            "name" : "amount",
            "unit" : "\u00B0"
          }
        ]
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   change energy",
        "format" : "set energy energy + {0}",
        "params" : [ { "type" : "range", "min" : -20, "max" : 20, "step" : 0.5, "default" : 1, "name" : "amount" }]
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   hatch",
        "format" : "hatch 1",
        "blockColor" : "#916da0",
        "params" : [
          { "type" : "int", "min" : 1, "name" : "child count", "default" : 1 }
        ]
      },

      {
        "action" : "die",
        "blockColor" : "#916da0",
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC3A   if energy <= 0?",
        "format" : "if energy <= 0",
        "blockColor" : "#89a",
        "clauses" : [ ]
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC11   if sheep-here?",
        "format" : "if any? sheep-here",
        "blockColor" : "#89a",
        "clauses" : [ ]
      },

      {
        "action" : "\uD83D\uDC11   ask sheep-here",
        "blockColor" : "#89a",
        "format" : "ask sheep-here",

      {

        ]
      }
    ]
  };
